00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:14,000
I've seen the devil down sunset in every place and every face.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,360
Tell me, do you see her?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,820
She's living her life.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,360
Even if she got us like she don't want them all night.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,320
But if you knew her, she lives alive.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,220
She goes up a barber, I see then she acts surprised.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:10,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm trying to own it, let it all right

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,980
You can't take my soul without a fucking fight

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

13
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,540
I know what you need, oh, oh, oh

14
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,340
She just will play it, I know what you need

15
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

16
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,940
Give a look to you, it's trying to make me

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,260
I'm putting in a face, but you're so incapable

18
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,800
Ooh, baby, not anything

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,980
She's based in the sky, oh, fashion lies

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,980
Is all she ever wants is

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,140
Freaking underneath, took me back it up

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,980
Bad to dream, took me back it up

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,460
Feeling you on, took me back

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Sailing, solved, took me back it up

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,860
I'll be with you, just took me back it up

26
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,220
Everybody's screaming, she got me up

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,980
She made him scream, push it up, yeah

28
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,140
Never be free, but she got me alive

29
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,980
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,400
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,740
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

33
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:43,900
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,160
Bad to fall, make you on top of her

35
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,800
Anybody who's out for me, when you on top of her

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm standing for a little me, cause you're not a bad one

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm walking up, I'm on to be my blood

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,780
She ain't there, 20 a man, but she's running up

39
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,200
She can never be broke, cause she's not a blood

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
She can never get off for the following

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,040
Faking on the knees, took me back it up

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,460
That's a dream, took me back it up

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,880
Kill anyone, took me back it up

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,040
Tell them, so I'll tell me back it up

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
I'll be with you, just took me back it up

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Everybody's screaming, cause she got me up

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,580
She ain't been screaming, cause she back it up

48
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
She ain't been free, cause she back it up
