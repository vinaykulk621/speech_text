00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thanks for watching!

2
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,560
I do the same, Think I told you that I never would

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,420
I told you I'd change, Even when I knew I never could

4
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,180
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,240
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey, hey

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,220
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,620
I realize the time that I wasted

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,560
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right, yeah

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,420

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,140

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,440
I do the same, Think I told you that I never would

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,320
I told you I'd change, Even when I knew I never could

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,120
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you

If not nobody else as good as you

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,700
When I'm away from you I miss your touch

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
You're the reason I believe in love

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,380
It's been difficult for me to trust

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,800
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,340
Ain't no way that I could leave you stranded

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,140
Cause you ain't never left me empty handed

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,860
And you know that I know that I can't live without you

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,160
