00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,800
PM

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
I do the same thing I told you that I'll never will

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,560
I told you I changed Even when I know I never could

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,360
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,580
I need you to stay, can you to stay?

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,800
I can't strong, wake up, I'm wasted

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
I realized it's time that I'm wasted

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,040
I feel like you can't feel the way I will

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,560
Be fucked up if you can be right

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:02,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,600
Be fucked up if you can be right

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,580
I do the same thing I told you that I'll never will

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,460
I told you I changed Even when I know I never could

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,220
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,440
I need you to stay, can you stay?

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,900
I do the same thing I told you that I'll never will

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,740
I told you I changed Even when I know I'm never could

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,540
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,720
I need you to stay, can you stay?

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,920
When I'm away from you I miss your touch

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,100
Your threes and I believe a love

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,520
It's been difficult for me to trust

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,220
And I'm afraid that I'm a fuck it up

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,340
And I wait that I can leave you stranded

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,460
Cause you ain't never let me empty

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,060
Hand it, and you know that I know that I can fit without you

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,580
So conditioned that you won't find nothing

28
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:09,880
And I never could find nobody else as good as bulging

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,160


31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,320
What you did, there was no other reason

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,320


33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,320


34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,380
I think I told you that I'm never one

36
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,460
I told you I tried

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,260
She know when I knew I never could

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,300
Know that I can't

39
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,620
It's time nobody else is good

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Is you how to use

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,960
Can you stay?

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,180


43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,080
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,940
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
