00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
A man walks into a bar and sees a tiny piano in the corner with a little man

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,320
no more than a foot tall, playing beautiful music on it.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Curious, he asks the bartender, “Where did you find this incredible musician?"

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,320
The bartender points to a dusty old lamp on the bar and says, “Rub that, and you can make a wish.”

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,320
Excited, the man rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,320
The man eagerly wishes for a million bucks. Suddenly, the bar fills with quacking ducks.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,320
there are ducks everywhere, on the tables, the floor, even flying around the room!

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:47,320
The man, shocked, says to the bartender, “I think your genie has a hearing problem. I asked for a million bucks, not ducks!”

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,320
The bartender shakes his head and replies, “You think I asked for a twelve-inch pianist?”
